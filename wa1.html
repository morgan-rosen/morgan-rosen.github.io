    <h1>Morgan Rosen</h1>
    <p>Hi Im Morgan, Im from Chicago, Illinois, and I’m entering my senior year at the University of Colorado Boulder. I’m pursuing a degree in Psychology with a minor in Creative Technology and Design (CTD).</p>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I enjoy expressing my creativity through art, exploring the mountains, and spending time with my dogs.</p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I’m passionate about understanding the brain and exploring why people think and behave the way they do. I also have a deep love for all things art—creating, designing, and finding new ways to bring ideas to life.</p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>I joined the field of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) to combine my academic background in psychology with my commitment to helping others.. While I’m still exploring what my long-term career will look like, I know I want it to be something that blends creativity, psychology, and child development.</p>
